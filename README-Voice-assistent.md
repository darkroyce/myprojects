I am developing a program for logistics using Python 3 and some frameworks-libraries. 
The plan is:
  Create a voice assistent that will open chrome, play music, say the time.
  Add a function that can search for companies in the DICT Excel file.
  Add a function that will do all searches by itself with the voice command of employee.
  Copy and paste the data from DATA to MAIN Excel file.
